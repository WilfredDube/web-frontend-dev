        Whenever you use the ...element, anything following it starts from the
        next line. This tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not
        need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between
        them. The ;;;tag has a space between the characters br and the forward
        slash.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the
        line break, while if you miss the forward slash character and just
        use... it is not valid in XHTML.
