    Whenever you use the ...element, anything following it starts from the next
    line. This tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need
    opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them. The
    ;;;tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash. If you
    omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break,
    while if you miss the forward slash character and just use... it is not
    valid in &quot;XHTML&#34;. 5 &gt; 3
